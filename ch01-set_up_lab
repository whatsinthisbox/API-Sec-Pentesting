Setting Up Kali Linux and More
Lab Setup

In this course, we will be using Kali Linux as our operating system with tools like Postman, Burp Suite, Wfuzz, and Kiterunner.  You may use any operating system that you would like, but the tools and techniques of this course will be demonstrated using Kali. The tools that we will be using are all free, but because of this benefit, there are some limitations. For example, the free community edition of Burp Suite throttles scans to the point where it becomes unrealistic to use in a professional setting. So, I do advise you to upgrade to professional/enterprise versions of applications when you move into that setting. For the purpose of this course, you will be able to learn the tools and techniques without paying for software upgrades.
Install a Hypervisor (VMware)

Download and install VMware to host your Kali Linux VM.

https://www.vmware.com/go/getplayer-win 

 
Install Kali Linux

Download and Install the Kali VMWare 64-bit VM.

https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines 

For additional help with installation, please read the Kali.org docs (https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/).

User: kali

Pass: kali

 
Update Kali

Once you have your Kali VM up and running, open the Kali Linux Terminal and use the following commands to update your system:

$ sudo apt update -y

$ sudo apt upgrade -y

$ sudo apt dist-upgrade -y

 
Update User Accounts

When starting a new operating system it is always a great idea to update default credentials:

$ sudo passwd kali    (enter in a new more complex password)

$ sudo useradd -m hapihacker

$ sudo usermod -a -G sudo hapihacker

$ sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh hapihacker

  
Burp Suite Community Edition

Burp Suite should come stock with the latest version of Kali, but if it does not then use the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install burpsuite -y

 Download Jython (https://www.jython.org/download.html) and add the .jar file to the Extender Options:

Under the Extender BApp Store search for Autorize and install the extension.

 

 
Foxy Proxy Standard

While Firefox is open use the shortcut CTRL+Shift+A or navigate to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon.

    Search for FoxyProxy Standard.
    Add FoxyProxy to Firefox.
    Install FoxyProxy Standard and add it to your browser.
    Click the fox icon at the top-right corner of your browser (next to the URL) and select Options.
    Select Proxies >Add New Proxy >Manual Proxy Configuration.
    Add 127.0.0.1 as the host IP address.
    Update the port to 8080 (Burp Suite’s default proxy settings).
    Under the General tab, rename the proxy to BurpSuite.
    Add a second new proxy:
        Add 127.0.0.1 as the host IP address.
        Update the port to 5555
        Under the General tab, rename the proxy to Postman

 
Burp Suite Certificate

    Start Burp Suite.
    Open your browser of choice.
    Using FoxyProxy, select the BurpSuite proxy. Navigate to http://burpsuite and click the CA Certificate. This should initiate the download of the Burp Suite CA certificate.
    Save the certificate somewhere you can find it.
    Open your browser and import the certificate. In Firefox, open Preferences and use the search bar to look up certificates. Import the certificate.
    In Chrome, open Settings, use the search bar to look up certificates,
    select More>Manage Certificates>Authorities, and import the certificate. If you do not see the BurpSuite cacert.der certificate. (You may need to expand the file type options to “DER” or “All files").

Now that you have the PortSwigger CA certificate added to your browser, you should be able to intercept traffic without experiencing issues.

 
MITMweb Certificate Setup

Now we will also import the cert for MITMweb through a very similar process.

    Stop burpsuite (it's listening on 8080 and mitmweb needs that to work)
    Start mitmweb from the terminal:
    $mitmweb
    Use FoxyProxy in Firefox to send traffic to the BurpSuite proxy (8080).
    Using Firefox Visit mitm.it.
    Download the mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem for Firefox. 
    Return to the Firefox certificates (see Burp Suite Certificate instructions).
    Import the MITMweb (mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem) certificate.
